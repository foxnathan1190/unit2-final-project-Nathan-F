<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>A full-stack web application built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL that provides users with secure profile management and an interactive brewery search. The application leverages an external RESTful API to allow users to search for breweries by city or name, and features a persistence layer that enables signed-in users to save favorite breweries to their profile for future reference.</p>
