<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>A full-stack web application built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL that provides users with secure profile management and an interactive brewery search. The application leverages an external RESTful API to allow users to search for breweries by city or name, and features a persistence layer that enables signed-in users to save favorite breweries to their profile for future reference.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>User Authentication & Profiles</td>
    <td>Users can sign in and create a personal profile. This establishes a unique user identity within the application, providing personalized access.</td>
    <td>Secure data handling, CRUD functionality, and data modeling in MySQL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Modern UI & UX</td>
    <td>A modern user interface greets the user after profile creation, ensuring a clear, responsive, and engaging experience.</td>
    <td>Frontend development skills (e.g., React, Vite, JavaScript/HTML/CSS).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interactive Brewery Search</td>
    <td>An interactive search function allows users to look up breweries. Search can be performed either by specifying a city or by searching for the brewery's name.</td>
    <td>External API Integration, asynchronous data fetching, and front-end state management.</td>
    <tr>
      <td>Favorite/Saved Breweries</td>
      <td>Signed-in users can save breweries they find during their search to their personal profile for later viewing.</td>
      <td>Backend persistence (Spring Boot and MySQL) and data relationship management (e.g., a many-to-many relationship between users and breweries).</td>
