<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>A full-stack web application built using Java Spring Boot and MySQL that provides users with secure profile management and an interactive brewery search. The application leverages an external RESTful API to allow users to search for breweries by city or name, and features a persistence layer that enables signed-in users to save favorite breweries to their profile for future reference.</p>

<h2>Core Features</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature Category</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Technical Showcase</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>User Authentication & Profiles</td>
    <td>Users can sign in and create a personal profile. This establishes a unique user identity within the application, providing personalized access.</td>
    <td>Secure data handling, CRUD functionality, and data modeling in MySQL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Modern UI & UX</td>
    <td>A modern user interface greets the user after profile creation, ensuring a clear, responsive, and engaging experience.</td>
    <td>Frontend development skills (e.g., React, Vite, JavaScript/HTML/CSS).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interactive Brewery Search</td>
    <td>An interactive search function allows users to look up breweries. Search can be performed either by specifying a city or by searching for the brewery's name.</td>
    <td>External API Integration, asynchronous data fetching, and front-end state management.</td>
    <tr>
      <td>Favorite/Saved Breweries</td>
      <td>Signed-in users can save breweries they find during their search to their personal profile for later viewing.</td>
      <td>Backend persistence (Spring Boot and MySQL) and data relationship management (e.g., a many-to-many relationship between users and breweries).</td>
    </tr>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Architectural Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Full-Stack Architecture: Successful integration of a dedicated frontend with a powerful backend.</li>
  <li>Java Spring Boot Backend: The core business logic is handled by a robust, industry-standard Java framework.</li>
  <li>MySQL Data Persistence: All user profiles and saved brewery lists are reliably stored in a relational database.</li>
</ul>

  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Function in the Project</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JavaScript</td>
    <td>Core language for the entire frontend logic and interactivity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>React</td>
    <td>Builds the modern UI and manages the application's client-side state, handling the interactive search and profile display.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vite</td>
    <td>Serves as the build and dev server for the React application, ensuring speed and efficiency during development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>React Router</td>
    <td>Manages navigation, allowing users to move between different views (like the main search page, the profile, and perhaps brewery details) without a full page reload.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSS</td>
    <td>Styles the application to deliver the "modern UI" experience.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Font Awesome</td>
    <td>Provides scalable, vector-based icons to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application (e.g., save icon, search icon).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Google Fonts</td>
    <td>Used to define the typography of the application, contributing to the professional, modern aesthetic.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Java</td>
    <td>The core language used to build the server-side API and business logic.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Spring Boot</td>
    <td>Used to quickly build a robust RESTful API for handling requests from the frontend, managing user authentication, and performing database operations.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Maven</td>
    <td>Handles project dependencies (Spring Boot libraries, Hibernate, etc.) and packages the Java application for deployment.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Hibernate</td>
    <td>Manages the seamless transfer of data between the Java objects in your Spring Boot application and the rows/columns in the MySQL database.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>MySQL</td>
    <td>The persistent data store for saving user profiles and the list of breweries marked as favorites.</td>
